## Learning 3d
This project is experiment where i learning to render 3d from scratch pixel by pixel based on this [book](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch)<br />
It is basically just Raytracing algorithm except that it is from scratch. <br />
I'm using raylib binding for golang because why not 🤷‍♂️?
